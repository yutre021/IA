Here i gonna set a free material talking about AI and ML

Here is gonna be a json file with all learning, is gonna be talking AZURE, GEMINI and all
FEATURES OF AI


But lest start of history of ML

# 1950 - Alan Turing

 - [Article of the first thinking machine](https://archive.org/details/MIND--COMPUTING-MACHINERY-AND-INTELLIGENCE)

# Theory of Probability
- [PT Language](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teoria_das_probabilidades)
 
 Fundamental of statistics was  build in century XVII.

 - The GOL: Analisys and model of data
 - [In 1800, Francis Galton e Karl Pearson. R. A. Fisher, Statistics Modern started](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-7/issue-1/R-A-Fisher-The-Founder-of-Modern-Statistics/10.1214/ss/1177011442.full)


 # EDA Exploratory Data Analisys
 [EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

 - In 1962, John Tukey, start the analisys exploration data, and bring a new era of ML

## Learning

The supervised machine, is when the machine is set data to mess with and find the best
solution to the target propose.

The unsupervised machine, is when the machine decid by data learned, by him self turn on new data 

Have one way that is the both sides, that human just give on sentence and the ML start the way, human can interfer but the computer give the last way


The Quantum Computing, gonna set a new Era of analysis data, my research about this is just in beginning
